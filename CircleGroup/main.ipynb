    "# The Circle Group\n",
    "The circle group is the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{S}^1$ of all complex numbers with absolute value 1, ie the unit circle in the complex plane.\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{S}^1 = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb C : |z| = 1 \\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## $\\mathbb{U}(1)$\n",
    "The circle group is also the group $\\mathbb{U}(1)$ of $1 \\times 1$ complex-valued unitary matrices, that act on the complex plane by rotation about the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, a complex square matrix $U$ is unitary if its conjugate transpose $U*$ is also its inverse. It is the complex analogue to an orthogonal matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unitary matrices preserve norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponential map\n",
    "The circle group can be parametrized by the angle $\\theta$ of rotation (in radians, counterclockwise from the positive x axis) by $\\theta \\mapsto z = e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta,$ which is its exponent map $\\exp : \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb{S}^1$, ie from the additive real numbers to the multiplicative circle group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplication of complex numbers corresponds to the addition of angles : $e^{i\\theta_1}e^{i\\theta_2} = e^{i(\\theta_1+\\theta_2)}.$\n",

    "## $\\operatorname{SO}(2)$\n",
    "The circle group is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group $\\operatorname{SO}(2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact we can represent complex numbers as $2 \\times 2$ real matrices, and then the unit complex numbers correspond to $2 \\times 2$ orthogonal matrices with unit determinant.\n",

    "And multiplying the matrices is equivalent to adding the angles.\n"
