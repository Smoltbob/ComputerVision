    "SO(3), the 3D rotation group, is the group of all roations about the origin of three-dimensional Euclidian space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ under the operation of composition ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_rotation_group)). \n",

    "- A rotation about the origin preserves the origin, euclidian distance and orientation.\n",
