# Composition Over Inheritance

Simple toy example taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance.

Main idea: favoring composition allows more code reuse and more flexible code.

This is because inheritance can lead to combinatorial explosion when multiple behaviors need to be inherited and combined.
With composition, a class instantiates different classes for each type of desired behavior.
